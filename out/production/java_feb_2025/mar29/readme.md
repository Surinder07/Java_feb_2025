## Recap March 29 


Inner classes 
1. Local Inner class 
2. Member inner class 
3. static inner class - oftenly used in prod code
4. Anonymous inner class 

## Wrapper classes ? 

type casting ? 
convert one type to another type 

int -> float 
Upcasting/downcasting


Autoboxing - 
Unboxing 

automatic conversion between primitive types to Object 



int             --  Integer
float           --  Float
long            -- Long
double          -- Double
char            -- Character
boolean         -- Boolean


## Immutable classes ? 

Strings - immutable ? 

all the fields should be private and final 
class should be final 
there should be no setter methods
we should override equals and hashcode method


## equals() and hashcode()
if two objects are equal they must have the same hashcode.

Object 1   - xtv12sd 
Object 2  -  xtv12sd


Internal implemention of HashMap  -- [Important question for interview]



## Collections

Data structure : how we structure our data for effient access or storage of data. 

Its framework for modifiying/manupulating objects. 

It has set of interfaces and classes which are already defined for us. 

                Iterable 
                    |
                    Collection [I] 
    |               |
  List[I]             Set[I]                  Queue[I]               
    |                   |                       |
ArrayList           HashSet                    PriorityQueue 
LinkedList          TreeSet
                    LinkedHashSet

    Map [I]
     |
   HashMap   

TreeMap  , LinkedHashMap, ConcurrentHashMap


Stack  


utitility classes 
1. Arrays [C]
2. Collections [C]



## Generics 

introuduced to have type safety in Java collections.

what is meant by Generic? 
advantage of using generics
1. Type safety 
2. Flexibility of choosing a collection type/object type



## Maven

It is a build tool. project management tool 

LOMBOK ? Library 
boiler plate code 

Autovalue


gradle : research about gradle


## File Handling ?

working with files and adding/removing , manupulating files
