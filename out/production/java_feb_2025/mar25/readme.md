## Recap 

1. Exception Handling 
2. exceptions -
checked  - Compile time  
and 
unchecked  - Runtime 


public void test(){

for(;;){


Thread.sleep();  // Interrupted Exception
}



}


How to handle?
1. try catch finally 
2. throw and throws

 30 minutes 
final vs finally vs finalize()

/*
Arithemetic
NullPointer
ArrayOutOfBound

        FileNotFound  -- checked exception
        IOException



        StackOverFlow error




         */



## Inner classes / Nested classes 

when a class defined inside another class 

1. Local Inner class  - class inside a method
2. Member Inner class   - class inside another class
3. Static Inner class   - IMP
4. Annoymous Inner class  - IMP


static ? 
1. variable 
2. method 
3. block 
4. class 



## 4. Annonymous Inner class - IMP
Java 8 Lambda - does not have name
Lambda - AWS - serverless server


classes without the name is called Annoymous inner class
This set the path of learning Java 8 Lambda
