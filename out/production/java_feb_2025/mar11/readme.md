## Recap 

Oops 
1. Inheritance - single , multi level
2. Polymorphism 
3. Abstraction 
4. Encapsulation

String vs stringbuffer vs string builder



A
|
B

class B extends A 



Benefits 
1. reusability 
2. Maintainance of the code 



                Vehicle[] 
    |         |                 |
Car             Bike            Train           Truck






Single 

Multi level 


directly it does not support in java classes
            A                   B
                |           |
                        C

supports in java iterfaces 


## Encapsulation

wraps the data into single unit...
programmer can control who can access what


private ? 

by default you should make all the fields/data members as private 
no one can access it outside. 












extends
