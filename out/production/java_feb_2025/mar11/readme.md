## Recap 

Oops 
1. Inheritance - single , multi level
2. Polymorphism 
3. Abstraction 
4. Encapsulation

String vs stringbuffer vs string builder



A
|
B

class B extends A 



Benefits 
1. reusability 
2. Maintainance of the code 



                Vehicle[] 
    |         |                 |
Car             Bike            Train           Truck






Single 

Multi level 


directly it does not support in java classes
            A                   B
                |           |
                        C

supports in java iterfaces 


## Encapsulation

wraps the data into single unit...
programmer can control who can access what


private ? 

by default you should make all the fields/data members as private 
no one can access it outside. 

Parent().display()
Child().
main()



## Execution 

Jvm execution 
stack 
1. main()



2. Child object is created 
Child() constructor is called


3. Parent() constructor called


## Problem statement 



Google doc? 

some files which are readonly 
write only 
read and write both. 


create a class 
take input as file 
make that file as readonly or write only 

FilePermission {

  boolean fileType;
  char ch;
 boolean isReadOnly;
boolean isWriteOnly;




}
