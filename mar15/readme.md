## Recap 


Inheritance 

Single , # Multiple , Multi level

encapsulation 


                    ByteCode
Student.java -----> Student.class
                    Compiled Code 


1. Inheritance 
2. Encapsulation 


## 3. Polymorphism

Compile time  - static Polymorphism 
[Method Overloading ]

sum(int a, int b){
return a + b;
}


sum(int a, int b, int c){
return a + b + c;
}

sum(int a, int b, int c, int d){
return a + b + c + d;
}



Runtime - Dynamic Polymorphism 
[Method Overriding]


same name and different implementation and this is acheived in
when there is inheritance 






## Compile 
javac Test.java   ----> .class file

# Runtime
java Test.Java    -----> to run the class
